# Machine Learning Models

This project implements core machine learning models from scratch in Python, without using any external ML libraries. The models are tested on various datasets, and the goal is to compare their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SallyAlsfadi/ML-PROJECT.git
cd ml-project-sallyalsafadi



pip install -r requirements.txt

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

# How to Run the Project
Each dataset has its own test file under tests/. To run a model on a dataset:
# Test all models on Breast Cancer dataset
python3 tests/test_all_models_breast_cancer.py or if you are using python not python3 just replace it.
 # Heart Failure dataset test
 python3 tests/test_all_models_Heart_Failure_dataset.py
  or
  python tests/test_all_models_Heart_Failure_dataset.py

# Mushroom dataset
python3 tests/test_all_models_mushroom.py

# Wine Quality dataset
python3 tests/test_all_models_wine_quality.py

# Robot Execution Failures dataset
python3 tests/test_all_models_robot_failures.py
```
